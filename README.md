# 💳 ATM Simulation System (Python Mini Project)

## 📘 Overview  
The ATM Simulation System is a Python-based mini project designed to mimic the basic functionalities of a real-world ATM. It allows users to check their account balance, deposit money, withdraw cash, and change their PIN securely. This project is ideal for beginners to explore core Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, file handling, and data validation.

## 🧠 Project Objectives  
- Simulate key ATM operations in Python  
- Implement user authentication using PIN verification  
- Apply basic file handling for storing account details  
- Strengthen understanding of decision-making and control flow  
- Provide a console-based, user-friendly interface

## ⚙️ Features  
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Login using a valid PIN  
- ✅ **Check Balance**: Display current account balance  
- ✅ **Deposit Money**: Add amount to the account securely  
- ✅ **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds if balance is sufficient  
- ✅ **Change PIN**: Update the existing PIN after verification  
- ✅ **Exit Option**: Safely terminate the session

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The program starts with a login screen asking for the user’s PIN  
2. Once authenticated, a menu is displayed with available options  
3. The user selects an operation (Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Change PIN, Exit)  
4. The system performs necessary validations (e.g., sufficient balance during withdrawal)  
5. Data is updated and displayed accordingly

## 💡 Sample Output  
```text
Welcome to Python ATM 💳  
Enter your 4-digit PIN: ****

1. Check Balance  
2. Deposit  
3. Withdraw  
4. Change PIN  
5. Exit  

Enter your choice: 1  
Your current balance is ₹10,000
```
